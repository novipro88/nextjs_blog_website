Description:
Far, far away, behind the mountains, far from the countries of Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated, they live in Bookmarksgrove, right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradise country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts; it is an almost unethographic life One day, however, a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last look back at the skyline of her hometown, Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village, and the subline of her own road, Line Lane. Pityful, a rhetorical question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.

Excerpt:
Distant, distant lands lie beyond the word-covered mountains, far removed from the realms of Vokalia and Consonantia. In those territories, the texts are devoid of sight.
